In todayâ€™s class, we will learn the basics of **PyTorch**, a popular deep learning framework, and use it to build and train a simple Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model.

We will cover:

- Basic PyTorch tensors and operations
- Defining an MLP model using `nn.Module`
- Setting up loss functions and optimizers
- Training
- Improving your model (mini-batch, dropout)
- Evaluating model performance on a validation set

## Exercise
You can find the training set from the following links:

- <a href ="https://github.com/wonjun-seo/cosmos/blob/master/static_files/labs/10/X_train.csv">X_train.csv</a>
- <a href ="https://github.com/wonjun-seo/cosmos/blob/master/static_files/labs/10/y_train.csv">y_train.csv</a>

Try to build your own model and let's see whose model is the best on test set!

Test set:
- <a href ="https://github.com/wonjun-seo/cosmos/blob/master/static_files/labs/10/X_train.csv">X_test.csv</a>
- <a href ="https://github.com/wonjun-seo/cosmos/blob/master/static_files/labs/10/y_train.csv">y_test.csv</a>
