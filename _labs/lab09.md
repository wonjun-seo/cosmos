## Gradient Descent
Last Friday, we learned one of the most important optimization techniques: **Gradient Descent**. Today, weâ€™ll briefly review it and explore how it can be applied in data science.

## MLP Construction
While popular Python libraries like **PyTorch** and **TensorFlow** make it easy to build neural network models, a simple **multi-layer perceptron (MLP)** can also be implemented using just NumPy.

Building an MLP from scratch helps deepen your understanding of the inner workings of neural networks.
